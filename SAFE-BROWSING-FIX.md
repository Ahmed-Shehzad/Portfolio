# Google Safe Browsing Issue Resolution

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your portfolio site has been flagged by Google Safe Browsing as a "deceptive site". This is **CRITICAL** and needs immediate attention.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Found:

1. **URL Inconsistencies**: Different Vercel deployment URLs in robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and API routes
2. **Placeholder Domains**: API routes were returning `your-vercel-domain.vercel.app`
3. **Mixed Domain References**: Caused confusion for Google's crawlers

### Security Flags Triggered:

- Domain hijacking indicators
- Phishing-like behavior due to URL mismatches
- Inconsistent meta information

## Fixes Applied

### 1. URL Consistency

âœ… **Fixed robots.txt**: Updated to use correct production URL
âœ… **Fixed sitemap.xml**: Updated to use correct production URL  
âœ… **Fixed API routes**: Updated robots and sitemap APIs with correct URLs

### 2. Enhanced Security Headers

âœ… **Strict Transport Security**: Added HSTS headers
âœ… **Content Security Policy**: Enhanced CSP with proper external domains
âœ… **Permissions Policy**: Added privacy-focused permissions policy
âœ… **Frame Protection**: Strengthened anti-clickjacking measures

### 3. Domain Verification

âœ… **Consistent Base URL**: All references now point to `portfolio-azure-five-75.vercel.app`
âœ… **Proper Sitemap**: Includes all language variants and key pages
âœ… **Robot Instructions**: Clear guidelines for search engine crawlers

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Deploy Changes Immediately

```bash
