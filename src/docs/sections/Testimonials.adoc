Displays client or peer feedback in a smooth, looping horizontal marquee with preprocessed rating metadata.

== Overview
`Testimonials` showcases social proof. The worker (`PROCESS_TESTIMONIALS`) enriches each testimonial with star objects, text metrics, company color, and accessible aria labels to reduce runtime computation.

== Data Enrichment
* Star rating array (5 items) generated ahead of render.
* Text metrics (length, word count, estimated read time).
* Company-specific color derived from hashed hue.

== Animation Approach
* Same two-duplicate marquee method as Tape.
* Slower duration (e.g., 45s) for legibility.

== Accessibility
* Each testimonial includes descriptive `aria-label` summarizing rating + author.
* Motion remains purely decorative; content readable statically if animation disabled.

== Performance
* Off-main-thread preprocessing reduces per-frame work.
* Avoids recalculating stars on each render.
