Seamless horizontal marquee of technology badges using two-duplicate translate loop animation.

== Overview
`Tape` displays a continuously scrolling row of technologies. Implementation duplicates the content exactly once and uses keyframes translating from 0 to -50% for a perfect loop without layout flashes.

== Animation Strategy
* Two identical content groups inside flex container.
* CSS keyframes: `transform: translateX(-50%)` at 100%.
* Duplicate group marked `aria-hidden` to avoid assistive repetition.

== Performance
* GPU-friendly transform animation.
* `will-change: transform` applied for smoother frames.

== Accessibility
* Avoid essential information only present in scrolling content.
* Provide discernible text for each badge (accessible names).
