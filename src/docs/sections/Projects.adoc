== Data Enrichment (Worker)
* Computes technology chip colors
* Calculates image aspect ratios + placeholder
* Marks external links with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `_blank` target

== Recommended Card Anatomy
* Image / media preview
* Title & concise description
* Technology chip list
* Links (demo, source)

== Copy Guidelines
* Focus on problem → solution → outcome.
* Quantify impact where possible.

== Accessibility
* Ensure link text is descriptive (avoid "Click here").
* Provide alt text summarizing each project thumbnail purpose.

== Performance Notes
* Prefer lazy-loading non-above-the-fold assets.
* Worker pre-processing reduces runtime layout calculations.
