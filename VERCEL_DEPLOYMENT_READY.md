## Deployment Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production-ready deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and use the correct settings
   - Environment variables will be automatically set by `vercel.json`
   - Build will use: `npm run build`
   - Deploy will be automatic on push to main branch

3. **Post-Deployment Verification:**
   - Check all pages load correctly
   - Test PDF download functionality
   - Verify responsive design works
   - Test contact form (if implemented)
   - Check performance metrics in Vercel dashboard

## Performance Metrics Expected:

- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
- Bundle size optimized with code splitting

## Post-Deployment:

- Domain can be configured in Vercel dashboard
- Analytics available in Vercel dashboard
- Automatic HTTPS enabled
- Global CDN distribution active
- Edge functions optimized
