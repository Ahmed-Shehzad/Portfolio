# Lighthouse CI Fix Applied âœ…

## Issue Resolution

### Problem:

The Lighthouse CI action was failing with the error:

```
Error: module is not defined
```

### Root Cause:

- Your `package.json` has `"type": "module"`, making all `.js` files ES modules
- The Lighthouse configuration file `lighthouse-config.js` was using CommonJS syntax (`module.exports`)
- This created a module system conflict

### Solution Applied:

1. **Renamed config file**: `.github/lighthouse/lighthouse-config.js` â†’ `.github/lighthouse/lighthouse-config.cjs`
2. **Updated workflow**: Changed `configPath` in `vercel-deploy.yml` to use the new `.cjs` file
3. **Added ESLint ignore**: Added `**/*.cjs` to ESLint ignore patterns to prevent linting conflicts

### Files Modified:

- âœ… `.github/lighthouse/lighthouse-config.cjs` (renamed and converted to CommonJS)
- âœ… `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml` (updated configPath)
- âœ… `eslint.config.mjs` (added .cjs ignore pattern)

### Technical Details:

- The `.cjs` extension forces Node.js to treat the file as CommonJS, regardless of package.json type
- This ensures compatibility with the Lighthouse CI action which expects CommonJS modules
- The configuration maintains all original lighthouse settings and thresholds

### Verification:

- âœ… Syntax validation passed: `node -c .github/lighthouse/lighthouse-config.cjs`
- âœ… ESLint validation passed: `npm run lint` (0 errors)
- âœ… Module system conflict resolved

### Next Steps:

Your Lighthouse CI should now work correctly in GitHub Actions. The next workflow run will:

1. Use the correct CommonJS configuration format
2. Successfully run performance audits on your deployed site
3. Generate lighthouse reports and upload artifacts

**Status: Ready for deployment** ðŸš€
