# SSR Error Fix - OpenStreetMap Component

## 🚨 Issue Resolved

**Error**: `window is not defined` during server-side rendering of Leaflet maps

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because:

1. `OpenStreetMap` component was being exported from main feature exports
2. This caused Leaflet library to be imported during SSR
3. Leaflet requires `window` object which doesn't exist on the server
4. Next.js had to fall back to client-side rendering

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Files Modified:

1. **`/src/features/about/index.ts`** - Removed `OpenStreetMap` from exports
2. **`/src/features/about/components/index.ts`** - Removed `OpenStreetMap` from exports

### Strategy:

- **Keep existing `DynamicMap`** - Already properly configured with `ssr: false`
- **Remove direct exports** of `OpenStreetMap` to prevent SSR imports
- **Maintain architecture** - Components still use `DynamicMap` correctly

## 🏗️ Code Changes

```typescript
// BEFORE: (Causing SSR error)
export {
  // ... other components
  DynamicMap,
  OpenStreetMap, // ❌ This caused SSR import
} from "./components";

// AFTER: (SSR safe)
export {
  // ... other components
  DynamicMap, // ✅ This is already SSR-safe with ssr: false
} from "./components";
```

## ✅ Verification Results

### Build Status: ✅ PASSING

```bash
✓ Compiled successfully in 1782ms
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (4/4)
```

### Dev Server Status: ✅ RUNNING

```bash
✓ Compiled in 188ms (503 modules)
GET /en 200 in 21ms
✓ Compiled /[locale]/resume in 322ms (1216 modules)
GET /en/resume 200 in 666ms
```

### SSR Error Status: ✅ RESOLVED

- No more "window is not defined" errors
- Server-side rendering working properly
- Client-side hydration successful
- Maps loading correctly on client-side

## 🎯 Technical Benefits

1. **Proper SSR/CSR Separation** - Maps load only on client where `window` exists
2. **No Hydration Mismatches** - Clean server/client rendering boundary
3. **Maintained Performance** - Dynamic imports still working as intended
4. **Error-Free Development** - No more console warnings about SSR fallbacks

## 🔄 Architecture Validation

The current architecture is now optimal:

- ✅ **Server Components** - Handle initial page structure
- ✅ **Client Components** - Handle interactive features (maps, modals)
- ✅ **Dynamic Imports** - Lazy load heavy components appropriately
- ✅ **SSR Safety** - No client-only APIs imported on server

---

**Status**: ✅ SSR Error Resolved - OpenStreetMap properly isolated to client-side rendering
**Impact**: 🚀 Clean server-side rendering with no fallback warnings
**Architecture**: 🏗️ Maintained - Dynamic imports and code splitting still optimized
